 "caption": "Two mice are carrying food through the grass. One of the mice is using a twig to hold an object. They enter indoors, with one of them standing on a table and the other searching through bottles on a counter. They approach a television, where there's a chef on the screen. Suddenly, an elderly woman in the house wakes up and discovers the two mice. She grabs a shotgun and starts shooting at the mice. The mice climb onto a chandelier on the ceiling. The elderly woman frantically shoots at the chandelier, causing it to crash down from the ceiling. The fallen chandelier is full of mice, and they start fleeing in a frenzy. One mouse floats on top of a book, trying to catch up with its companions. It eventually floats into a sewer.",

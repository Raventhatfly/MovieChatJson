 "caption": "Two boys walked on the street and arrived at the school. Along the way, they greeted familiar faces and entered a classroom. In that classroom, a boy in a yellow shirt squeezed in beside them, and there was an owl on the desk. A girl was chewing bubblegum. When class ended, everyone casually moved around in the classroom. The boy picked up a book, slung his backpack over his shoulder, and headed outside. They reached the area outside the classroom, and he started reading the book again. A man came home with a newspaper, sat at the table with the boy.",

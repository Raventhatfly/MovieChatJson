 "caption": "A painter is hanging on the exterior wall while another person is climbing up. The painter nearly loses balance and almost falls. A car drives into the courtyard below, and Nazi soldiers salute the person in the car. At this moment, the paint bucket from above spills, splashing the Nazi officer in the face. Chaos ensues among the soldiers below. The two people quickly escape from the rooftop. One person parachutes down and lands on the roof. Inside the hall, a conductor is directing his orchestra, and an actor in red clothing rushes over to inspect the workers who seem to be repairing something like decorations. After a conversation with the military officer, the conductor angrily leaves the scene.",

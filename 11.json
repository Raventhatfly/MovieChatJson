 "caption": "Under the cover of night, a woman and a man engaged in deep conversation, their voices carrying the weight of their emotions. As dawn broke, the scene transitioned to the interior of a solemn church, where a pastor delivered a sermon that echoed with profound words of wisdom.The film then shifted to a rainy, melancholic day, with the relentless downpour soaking the man to the bone. Seeking refuge, he and the woman engaged in another conversation, but this time, the air was charged with unspoken feelings and smoldering tensions. Their words hung heavy in the damp air, hinting at a deeper connection that both desired but couldn't fully embrace. As the rain continued to pour, the man eventually walked away, leaving behind a lingering sense of longing and unresolved emotions.",

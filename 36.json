 "caption": "The sky is pouring with rain, and a boy is hiding behind a car. In a corridor, a teacher approaches a young boy sitting on the steps. It seems that two boys were caught sneaking food in a room by the teacher. At this moment, the teacher notices another boy singing in the classroom. The next morning, the teacher begins the class in the classroom. Under the teacher's guidance, the boys gather together to sing. As the teacher is about to leave, he suddenly pats his face and heads off to meet a student's mother.",

 "caption": "A cat was holding a letter, which it put in its pocket. A mouse was running down the street when a barrel rolled towards it, squashing the mouse into a flat sheet. Suddenly, a bucket fell from the sky, splattering a worker with paint. Bricks also rained down, reducing the cat to a mosaic of pieces. The mouse pulled the cat's brick-blocked body out and escaped. It ran into a room where someone was playing the violin. The cat saw the mouse hiding inside the violin and smashed it, breaking the violin. At that moment, the cat pulled out the letter and handed it to a man. On the stage, a beautiful woman appeared and went backstage to apply lipstick. Two men came looking for her. The cat and the mouse were also there. A mechanical hand attempted to steal a diamond and behind a dog guard, and eventually succeeded.",

 "caption": "Several penguins were at a roulette wheel, and a group of animals attempted to approach but got knocked over by the spinning wheel. Suddenly, a lion burst into the area, and all the animals quickly made way for him. The lion carried a zebra, a hippo, and a giraffe, advancing toward a group of animals. He opened his fearsome mouth, frightening them all away. The lion, wearing a floral wreath, sat at a long banquet table, surrounded by many monkeys. The lions and their companions boarded a massive ship. Four penguins sat in beach chairs, reading newspapers. Like the animals on the ship, they waved their goodbyes.",

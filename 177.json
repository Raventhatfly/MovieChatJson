 "caption": "A boy was spinning around beside a sprinkler in the garden. He picked up a football and ran towards the house. Inside the house, a man, his wife, and a very young child were present. Two older boys sat in front of the television, starting to watch TV. Their father unplugged the TV. The boy lay on a bed, and his father pulled the blanket off. The man and the boy went to a lake, where they boarded a boat. Several boys and a woman sat at a table. The woman placed several books on the table. The boy picked up a phone and started making calls. A man with a trumpet entered the room, lifting the boy's blanket once again. They dressed as soldiers and walked in a field.",

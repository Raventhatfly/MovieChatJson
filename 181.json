There was a man on the shore talking to him. The boy went to a gate and found a garbage truck there with another boy. A father and son sat at a table, reading newspapers. They went to chase after a little dog. The boy brought something over to the dog. A family sat at a table to eat, and the boy went outside to meet his friends. He returned to the poolside.",

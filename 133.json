 "caption": "Three chipmunks huddled under a blanket, and the one in green clothing scurried next to a sleeping man. The following day, two chipmunks perched on trays in a restaurant. Inside the eatery, numerous patrons laughed heartily at the chipmunks. One tray got knocked over, and a chipmunk lay on top of it. During the night, inside an apartment, three chipmunks were dancing. They had a man in blue attire standing before them. In a hospital, a man lay in bed making a phone call. During the day, a group of people dined outdoors. The chipmunks hopped onto the table.",

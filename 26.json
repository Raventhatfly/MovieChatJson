 "caption": "Several carriages raced through a canyon. An elderly woman, armed with a long-barreled gun, rode in one of the carriages and fired fiercely at the carriage carrying the cat and the egg next to her. The cat's carriage plummeted from the cliff but miraculously transformed into a glider, safely landing and escaping danger. The two cats embarked on their journey again, sitting in a carriage and chatting. The egg and the two cats found themselves in the middle of the desert. They reached their destination and burryied a seed. Suddenly, a massive storm erupted, and the seeds rapidly grew into towering trees that pierced the sky. The two cats and the egg climbed the colossal tree to its summit, reaching the clouds above.",

 "caption": "The scene unfolds with a turbulent and surging ocean. Two individuals are aboard a boat, sailing on the open sea. One of them takes out a camera and starts taking pictures. A whale's tail emerges from the sea's surface. The man continuously clicks the shutter and takes notes in his notebook. One of the men pulls out his phone. Then, one of the men holds a line and casts one end of it into the water. The other person dons diving gear and submerges into the water to capture underwater footage of the whale. The man on the boat wears headphones and continues taking notes. The whale moves through the water, occasionally surfacing for breath before diving again.",

 "caption": "On a computer screen, two simulated galaxies are colliding towards each other, absorbing each other. Behind a man, a row of radio telescopes stretches into the distance. Various galaxies scatter across the cosmos. The man ventures into a barren land and picks up a stone. Inside an instrument room, he enters a cabin. Another person helps him fasten his seatbelt and presses a button. They seal the cabin door. The machine begins to spin faster and faster. In the control room, people monitor the man who is inside the machine via a screen. Various instruments are displaying data on some other screens.",

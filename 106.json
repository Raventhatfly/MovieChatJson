 "caption": "In the midst of a lion pride, two male lions engage in conversation. Hippos, lions, zebras, and giraffes sit by the lake on the grassy savannah, enjoying the beautiful sunset. Several penguins use a glass bottle to observe something. One of the penguins pretends to collapse in the middle of the road. A jeep comes to a halt, and the remaining penguins hastily jump into the vehicle before driving away, leaving a group of people behind. Suddenly, an elderly lady emerges from the back seat of the jeep, having been thrown from the vehicle. She encounters the others and rushes into the vast grasslands. At night, three lions enter a cave, while the lady and her companions venture into the jungle and sit by a campfire.",

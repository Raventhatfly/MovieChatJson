 "caption": "A menacing dog approaches the small hole and extends its paw inside, where two tiny people huddle together â€“ a girl and a boy. They work together to push a large stone, causing a crack to appear in the wall. As they manage to escape, the boy attempts to use a fork as a weapon. They find themselves in another cave and discover some candles. After lighting them, they venture deeper into the cave, where they stumble upon a cheese trap. The boy gets caught in a mousetrap, but a large hand from the depths of the cave saves him. The girl frees the boy and traps the hand in the mousetrap. Exhausted, the boy and girl lie down on a bed to sleep. In the morning, a plane lands on the roof. An older man wakes the boy, and the two tiny individuals continue to explore the house.",

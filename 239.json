 "caption": "A large ship is anchored, and a small boat with two people is sailing in the sea. One of them holds a pole at the bow. Whales appear on the sea surface. The two individuals sit in front of computers, and one of them has a canister, engaging in conversation and laughter. The whales gracefully swim in the water, occasionally raising their tails above the surface and, at times, breaching to take a breath. People on the small boat use cameras to capture images of the whales. On the large ship, someone stands on an elevated platform, observing through binoculars. In the control room, one person is steering the ship, while another points towards the horizon. Later, there is an animated scene depicting whale calving. A group of people on the boat enjoys whale-watching. ",

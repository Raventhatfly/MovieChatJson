 "caption": "Someone is riding a motorcycle on a road. The motorcycle goes through a curve and falls off the cliff's edge. Two elderly people are watching nearby. A car arrives at a monastery. Night falls, and two people ride bicycles into a castle. They stop and begin to converse. Along the way, they encounter a group of soldiers. They hide in a corner as the soldiers pass by. After the soldiers leave, they carry their bicycles and enter a room. Suddenly, the lights inside the room come on. There are German soldiers having a birthday party inside. Soon, everyone starts riding chairs and bouncing around the room. After the banquet, the two people from earlier enter a room with a red blanket laid out.",

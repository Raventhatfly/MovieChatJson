 "caption": "The woman poured a plate of food into the pot and placed the lobster in the boy's container. She brought the pot to the dining table. The woman tasted a bite and took a sip of wine. Outdoors, there was a stage, and a group of boys sat on benches. A crowd of children gathered in front of a teacher, who stood at the podium. Soon, a group of people arrived, and the boys took their seats. An elderly man with white hair addressed the children, who watched a boy operating a machine. Suddenly, he returned to the real world, and the crowd applauded and cheered for him. A man made a phone call to a woman. Several children used a cart to transport rocks outdoors. They gathered around and brought out a pot. A boy approached an abandoned vehicle with many things tied to its back. He overturned the vehicle, and a group of boys lined up in front of the pot.",

 "caption": "A group of deer galloped through a marsh, creating splashes of water. A large bird stood on the ground, flapping its wings. The large bird picked up a piece of wood and flew over to two smaller birds. They began to play together, with the large bird watching over them. Suddenly, another large bird arrived. The first large bird regurgitated fish from its mouth to feed the smaller birds. On the grassland, numerous animals, including cement-like hippos and horses, engaged in fierce battles, opening their gaping mouths at each other. Some hippos wallowed in the mud. Then, a raging fire broke out on the grassland, causing the animals to scatter in all directions.",

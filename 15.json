 "caption": "A squirrel struggled to run on the icy surface, chasing its elusive acorn. The scene quickly shifted to a prehistoric plain where a mammoth, a saber-toothed tiger, and a prehistoric kangaroo roamed. They walked from day into night, and then back into day.Along the way, they encountered two attached mice. The saber-toothed tiger tried to catch them, but these marsupials were experts at digging holes. The mammoth reached a spot and came across another mammoth hanging head-down from a tree. They were both startled. Soon, their friends from outside, also hanging upside down, joined in. The upside-down mammoth jumped down from the tree and engaged in a conversation with its marsupial friends.",

The man later takes a seat at the dining table and then paces back and forth in the living room while gesturing with his hands. Shortly after, he opens the door and escorts the woman out. The next morning, a boy wakes up from his sleep. He goes to his father's room and wakes him up. Then, they head to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. The man cracks an egg into a cup and starts cooking. He puts something into a pan, but it quickly burns. Afterward, the man dresses in a suit and heads to work.",

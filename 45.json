 "caption": "Various bottles of potions fell from the table. The monster, along with the cat and a donkey, dodged them skillfully. They ended up in a mill and were nearly thrown off. A group of crossbowmen chased them, but a large container filled with purple liquid spilled, causing them to retreat. A man and a woman entered the room. The monster, the donkey, the cat, and the others arrived in an open space. The sky changed from clear to overcast and began pouring rain. They found shelter in a house. The house the monsters brought emitted a purple light. During the day, more people and a white horse arrived in the house. The cat remained the same as before.",

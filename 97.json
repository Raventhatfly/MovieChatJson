 "caption": "A mouse is in the kitchen sink, jumping out of it and hiding all around the kitchen. It scurries around, finally getting into a food cart. The cart is pushed into the dining area, and the mouse seizes the opportunity to sneak back into the kitchen. A skinny chef takes a ladle and pours himself a bowl of soup. After tasting it, he makes a distressed expression. The mouse climbs onto a table and starts adding various seasonings to the pot of soup. However, the skinny chef quickly spots it and hides the mouse in a container. Then, a short chef arrives and angrily grabs the skinny chef by the collar. Soon, someone takes the soup away, and the short chef follows in terror. He rides a bike into the night, arriving at a bridge.",

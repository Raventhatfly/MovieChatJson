 "caption": "The male protagonist, covered in dirt, found himself in a desolate ruin. He watched in fear as a bald-headed demon disintegrated into fragments step by step. The protagonist had a nosebleed. He walked into a grand hall filled with people, accompanied by his two friends. They reached the outside of a castle where the drawbridge was strewn with debris. The male protagonist stood on the bridge, broke a wand into two pieces, and threw them far away. Next, they arrived at a train station. By this time, the male protagonist and his friends had settled down and started families. They were sending their children off on a train.",

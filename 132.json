 "caption": "In the bathroom, two boys put chipmunks into the toilet. One chipmunk stands on the table. A woman signals them to go to her office. They sit at the woman's desk, and she talks to three chipmunks. The woman shows them her tattoo on her arm. A man walks in the hallway with a briefcase, which has three chipmunks on it. They enter a room, open the door, and together admire the night view outside the window. The scene shifts to another man, sitting at home and watching TV. A boy stands in the hallway, with a piece of paper taped behind him. Finally, one boy lies on the bed, sleeping.",

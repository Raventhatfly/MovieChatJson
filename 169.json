 "caption": "A cat had a brush tied to its head, and on top of it sat four little people. The cat encountered a dog, and the dog began to chase the cat. In front of a house, a car arrived, and the people in the car carried boxes into the house. The four little folks ran from the outside to the inside of the house. Among the clutter, they found an airplane. The airplane took off into the sky but ended up crashing into a tree and falling to the ground. A boy was operating a lawnmower, and he noticed the little people. He gently picked them up. Soon, an elderly man came over, took two of the little people in his hand, and showed a piece of paper to the boy.",

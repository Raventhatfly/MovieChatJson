 "caption": "Water droplets splashed, and a small fish fell from the sky into the water. Butterflies fluttered among the leaves, and a group of stars gathered at the water's edge. Along the riverbanks in the jungle, two birds perched above their nest. The birds were busy constructing their nests. Rain began to pour from the sky. Soon, there were hatchlings in the nest. The large bird carried food to feed the young ones. The birds' nest was beneath a rocky overhang. The camera followed the stream downstream and soon arrived at a river. Dense trees lined the riverbanks. Then, the camera reached a waterfall, where the water cascaded down. Above the river, many birds flew, dipping their beaks into the water to search for food.",

    In a jungle, a man opens a box, and inside lies another person. He carries that person to an open area. The sky is very dark. When morning comes, the man gets up from the bed. Another person is sleeping beside him. After obtaining a driver's license, he heads into the woods. Holding a weapon, he moves through the mist. He sees the bones of dead animals and uses a device to survey the area ahead. Suddenly, he is attacked by an animal. He struggles to free himself and then kills the creature with his weapon. The man continues deeper into the woods, and there he encounters another person, prompting him to raise his gun and give chase.",

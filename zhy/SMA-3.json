A man with a gun approaches her. She removes her white mask, and suddenly another person arrives, something red, and wraps up the man with the gun.  In the city, traffic flows. In an office, a man and a woman sit in front of an elderly lady. A man in white pants and a black top enters a convenience store and reaches his hand into a machine. Another burly man grabs a stick and attempts to strike the man in white, but the stick hits the burly man instead. The man in white pants places the machine horizontally on the ground, and there's a person in black clothing doing a handstand on the ceiling.",

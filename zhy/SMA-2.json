Many police cars and officers arrive in the city, followed by an explosion. The police officers stand ready with guns, but they are quickly ensnared in spiderwebs. Then, a bird-like person appears, engaging in a fierce battle with the white-clad hero. Afterward, a person with a red cape arrives. The person in white attire communicates with them, and they all engage in a life-and-death battle with the bird-like entity. Soon, a flying motorcycle appears, ridden by the person in the red cape, and they battle the bird-like entity and the white-clad hero in the skies above the city, even causing a helicopter to crash.",

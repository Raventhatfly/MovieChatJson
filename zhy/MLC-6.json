    "caption": "A girl is running back and forth on the roof, using threads to move around. A man is cooking inside the house. The man opens a door panel, revealing a girl in the room. A boy sits inside the house with a black cat. There's a black little creature and greenish smoke on the ground outside. The girl has a red little creature by her side. She sits on a stack of books on a suitcase. A woman knocks on the door. Inside, a man gets up, watches TV for a moment, then picks up something. At this moment, a purple little creature appears. A man in black clothing embraces a woman's phantom. He enters an alley and hugs two men. Then, he arrives at a prison. The man in black performs on stage under purple light. Time moves to the following day, in the daylight on the streets.",

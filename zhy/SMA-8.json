His mother and father are concerned about his superpowers, but they still believe in him. Highlights include: the boy's superpowers and his upbringing in the war-torn country, his parents' concern about his superpowers, his mother hoping he doesn't lose himself, his father reminding him that there are no lies between them, his mother blessing him, his father telling him that he will still be grounded when he returns, the boy playing games with his friends, and his mother wishing he would do more normal things.",

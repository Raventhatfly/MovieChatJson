    "caption": "Several girls are chatting in front of the camera. Later, these girls enter a building. Inside one of the rooms, the girl with blue hair introduces herself. Subsequently, she appears in a chemistry class, carefully pouring liquids from test tubes into bottles. In another scene, a man enters a room and sees a phantom of a woman. Suddenly, memories flood his mind. The girl with blue hair bumps into a girl in yellow at a doorway, and then she rushes to the library. There, she meets a boy wearing headphones who kindly helps her up after she accidentally falls. During the night, a man in a white suit is inside a house. The boy picks up a photograph in his room and later stands on a stage, attempting to reach for a woman with his hand, but she suddenly disappears. The man is holding something and stands in front of a painting.",

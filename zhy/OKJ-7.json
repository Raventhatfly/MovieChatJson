A group of people wearing black headgear followed, raising their guns and firing at the green-uniformed individuals coming from the opposite direction. The black headgear-clad group retrieved a projectile from the massive animal, then one person by a truck used a phone to search for information. Returning to the underground tunnel, the people in black headgear and the girl loaded the large animal onto a truck. A group of pursuers chased after them. The people with headgear removed their headgear within the truck compartment and interacted with the girl, showing her photos on an iPad.",

The man holds a piece of clothing, his back turned to the masked person. A girl inside the room expresses various emotions with hand gestures. The two of them engage in a conversation and later embrace. The man brings a box with an item inside. Suddenly, the girl changes back into the clothing with the mask. Spider-Man swings through the dusty streets, leaping between trains and roads. It's raining heavily in the sky. In a room, a boy in a coat and a woman embrace, and the woman talks to him.",

She picked up some coins from the floor, and the old man repeatedly tried to stop her. The girl ran outside, and the old man followed, disappearing into the night. The girl entered a subway and then went into a modern office building. She knocked on the glass, and a woman inside motioned for her to make a phone call. The woman inside hung up the phone and abruptly left. The girl kicked the glass, and it didn't break at first, but then, inexplicably, it shattered. She barged into the office.",

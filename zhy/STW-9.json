Suddenly, a huge, mobile rock appears in front. The woman continues to sit in the pilot's seat while the boy takes a seat beside her. The airship arrives at a place covered in vines and inhabited by red bird-like creatures flying around. A man pours a few green spheres onto a piece of paper and crushes them with a tool. He loads the resulting powder into a gun and starts shooting at the creatures outside. Inside the cabin, a group of people is processing tools. The boy stands by the railing with a blue, glowing creature. The man in green clothing comes over to the boy.",

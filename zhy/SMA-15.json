A woman changes into a set of glowing purple attire. Inside a control room, someone operates machinery. The room is filled with people of various colors. A man appears in the space, and it seems like a fight is breaking out among many people. A man turns to face a group of individuals. A girl attempts to communicate with the man but is grabbed by a spider-like mechanical arm. The man emits a variety of colorful lights and enters a space. Spider-Man lies on the ground, taking cover. The man teleports from one location to another. Inside a house, there's a man and a woman watching a baby in a stroller. A masked person enters the house, where a man is sleeping.",

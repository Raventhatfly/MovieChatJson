The truck stops at a certain place, and the girl walks out, but a man tries to stop her. They arrive at a place with many animals, and these animals are being herded into a building through a passage. The girl runs forward along the passage, where workers are cleaning bloodstains, and there are chunks of meat hanging on the walls. It seems to be an overflow from a factory, with food processing lines. Workers are busy in the factory, and huge animals are being slaughtered by machines. A group of people quickly arrives there, arresting a man, finding the little girl, and communicating with her.",

He needs help finding a large bomb, but he also has to be careful not to be discovered by Spider-Man. Eventually, he meets a newcomer named Miles, and together they participate in a competition and befriend someone referred to as Pav. Key points include: the protagonist realizing his superpowers and wanting to harness more dark energy, his search for a large bomb, his cautiousness around Spider-Man, meeting a newcomer and participating in a competition together, making a friend who has been around for six months while the newcomer hasn't even been there for a month, and the protagonist's encounter with a police officer from Spider-Man's city, Mumbai, California.",

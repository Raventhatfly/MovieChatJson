Suddenly, the lights and shelves in the room begin to shake. They rush outside and find a massive airship landing. A woman steps out of the airship and enters the house. They look out of the window, and the man has a conversation with the boy who becomes upset and heads upstairs. The man takes out a compass and straps on a backpack. He enters the interior of the massive airship, and it takes off. In a screening room, a woman is giving a presentation with slides. The airship enters a large pit, and the man walks out and sees many glowing green vines inside the cabin.",

He befriended a girl who also had similar abilities. He hoped to find another Spider-Man to help him, but he had already left. In the end, the young man decided to continue the work of Spider-Man to protect people. Highlights include: the young man's transformation after being bitten by a radio-active spider, him not being the only Spider-Man, his friendship with the female Spider-Man, his attempt to seek help from another Spider-Man, the departure of the other Spider-Man, his decision to continue the role, his reluctance to hurt others, their capture of a wrongdoer, and his determination to protect people.",

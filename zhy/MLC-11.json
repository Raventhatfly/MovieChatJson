A girl produces a red object and changes into red clothing. She walks through the ruins of the city. A mother and daughter run in the ruins, and the girl in red protects them. A boy lies on a bed with a flashing ring on his hand. The girl in red tries to block the purple clouds but is blown away. Suddenly, a boy in black clothing appears. He climbs to the top of a tower, and the tower of the Eiffel Tower collapses. The boy falls into the water, and the girl rescues him. At that moment, a man approaches, and the girl collapses to the ground but later gets up.",

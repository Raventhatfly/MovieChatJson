In front of a computer, a person is typing on a keyboard. Someone wearing a black mask touches a glowing object, resulting in a powerful electric shock in their hand. Then, a person with a guitar appears. Several people fly around inside a room. A person in white attire grasps the neck of the person in black attire, causing a massive explosion. The white figure vanishes into a chaotic black void. The scene turns black and white, and a chaotic mass emerges. Everyone starts running. A building appears to have been severed in half, and city structures begin to collapse. Several people are flying in the air.",

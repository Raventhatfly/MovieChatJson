In a school, a girl plays the flute and does gymnastics. The boy and girl sit on the street, then head to the cinema. They visit the Eiffel Tower, with two cars parked nearby. They share ice cream together. On a rooftop at night, they dance around. The girl prepares a gift indoors, while the boy balances on a beam. The boy jumps down from the beam, and they have a conversation on the stage. The boy then goes to a piano, and behind the curtain appear stars, the moon, and clouds. They are back on the rooftop again.",

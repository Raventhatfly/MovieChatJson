There's a man in a cape flying around, and several people are suspended on wires, soaring through the dark city. The girl uses a thread to pull the boy. Some people are balancing on water pipes. A man is holding a child. The boy arrives at what seems like a hot place, opens an iron gate, and falls down. Several people are racing around in cars, seemingly engaged in a brawl. One person clings to a rising aircraft, grappling with another person on its surface. The boy is firmly held down, with a crowd of people below them.",

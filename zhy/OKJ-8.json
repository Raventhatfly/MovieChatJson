Another man in a uniform took out an electronic device and touched the massive creature beside him. Everyone held each other tightly, and the man also embraced the girl tightly. They opened the car door and waved to the vehicles behind. The truck came to a stop, and many police officers disembarked from the police cars in the front. The people with black headgear leaped from the bridge to escape, leaving only the girl and the massive animal in the vehicle. In an office, many people gathered, watching news reports on a television screen.",

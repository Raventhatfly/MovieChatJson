The creature plunges into the water, where there are boats on the surface. Suddenly, the creature appears in a subway station, terrifying the people. The girl in red clothing dangles from a line under a bridge as a subway train passes over the bridge, colliding with the creature, creating a purple smoke. Behind the boy and the girl, an old man appears. The boy climbs to the rooftop, then runs above the clouds.",

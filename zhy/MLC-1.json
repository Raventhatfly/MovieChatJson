    "caption": "An elderly man is lighting a fire, and in front of him lies a colorful plate. Suddenly, a flash of purple light transforms it into a monster. Then, a red and a green-colored elf appears. In a bakery under the Eiffel Tower in Paris, a blue-haired girl walks in and encounters a burly baker. The girl proceeds to sit on the street, enjoying a cup of coffee. Later, many barrels roll down from a vehicle, and the girl rides a bicycle across a bridge. She opens a notebook, jotting down something, and the words in her notebook seem to come to life, immersing her in a fantasy world. A luxurious car arrives in front of a house, and a man enters the building, walking along a red carpet. Suddenly, a skateboarder zooms past, colliding with a girl and spilling coffee on another girl. The girl in red clothing grabs the blue-haired girl by her collar.",

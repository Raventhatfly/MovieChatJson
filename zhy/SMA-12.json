The boy and a girl arrive at an open area where a platform filled with screens slowly descends, and there's a man on it. Suddenly, a man dressed in pink appears upside down behind them. The boy talks with the man in pink for a few moments. A small baby is crawling up high, and the man upside down rescues the baby. He shows pictures of the baby on his phone to everyone. The boy is surrounded by red lines along with a group of people. The man then starts looking at a screen again.",

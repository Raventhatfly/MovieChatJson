    "caption": "The video begins with a comic book scene, showing many people fleeing. A man is holding a child, and there are many other people escaping in the background. The scene turns black and white. A group of people gathers, and a man pats the boy's shoulder. The boy stands in the center of this group, surrounded by a red light. Inside a building, numerous Spider-Men are present. One Spider-Man with four extra arms emerges from a passage, and they all fly around within the building. A boy is seen training inside the building. Two individuals jump out of the high-rise building's glass from an upper floor, and they begin to fly between the city's buildings.",

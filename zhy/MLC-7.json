Later, the two individuals exit the building. A woman performs magic, causing police cars to explode. The boy walks on the street. A couple is watching TV at home. Two boys and two girls meet on the street. A man disguises himself with balloons and wears a pink wig. The boy receives a phone call and leaves. The two girls are having a conversation in an amusement park. Some people are on a roller coaster, but it suddenly stops at the highest point. The two individuals who attempted the vault heist arrive at the amusement park and create a massive explosion using magic. People scatter in all directions. One of the girls enters a dark environment with a beam of light moving around.",

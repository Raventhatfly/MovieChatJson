The man tries to control the young Spider-Man to make him better, but the young Spider-Man feels he's already good enough. Eventually, the young Spider-Man decides to leave, and the man realizes his overprotectiveness and control were mistakes. Highlights include: the young Spider-Man being transformed by his father, the man's attempt to improve the young Spider-Man, the young Spider-Man's decision to leave, the man acknowledging his mistakes, the young Spider-Man's disdain for being turned into a hero, the man thinking the young Spider-Man is a good kid but also fearing him, the man suggesting the young Spider-Man should leave him, and the misunderstandings and gaps between them.",

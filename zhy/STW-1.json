    "caption": "The video begins with a castle and then transitions to black and white. Scenes show a town carriage, a hot air balloon, and a skeleton. Next, a burly man appears carrying a boy on his back. He stands at the entrance of a cave, and someone approaches, narrowly avoiding falling ice stalactites from the cave ceiling. The people are all dressed in thick clothing and carry heavy bags. One person reaches a glowing ice crystal. Suddenly, ice stalactites from the cave's ceiling start to fall. The burly man pulls another person up with a rope just in time. He and the other individual appear to argue, with someone else trying to mediate. The man leaves in frustration. The video then shifts to a farmland scene.",

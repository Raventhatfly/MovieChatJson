There was a parade on the street with a woman holding a bouquet chatting with a man in the dressing room. A man walked through the parade, making his way to the stage. He performed on the stage, and the audience cheered for him. Then, another woman came up, holding a microphone. She turned around to welcome a girl who also joined the stage. A group of people carried a giant balloon. The girl took out a piece of fruit from her bag and walked forward.",

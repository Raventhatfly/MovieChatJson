    "caption": "The girl picked up a calendar in the office. A woman and a security guard entered, chasing after her. The girl threw the calendar out, then locked herself in a meeting room. The security guard and the woman tried to open the door from the outside. The girl looked down to the floor below. A group of people was attempting to stuff a massive animal into a truck. The girl rushed into the hallway. The pursuing security guard and woman were relentless. The truck drove away, and the girl frantically chased after it. She took a giant step and jumped onto the truck, grabbing onto the side railing. The truck passed through a tunnel. At another end of the tunnel, vehicles with masked individuals inside waved to the driver of the truck carrying the animal. Inside the tunnel, the two trucks came to a halt. People wearing black headgear herded the massive animal off the truck. The girl ran towards the colossal animal, which started to run amok in the tunnel. The girl and the colossal animal made their way onto the streets.",

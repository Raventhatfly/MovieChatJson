On a balcony, a person in white attire grabs the one in black attire, who jumps down to rescue the man and the baby. They use ropes to pull a bus. Here, they find a man and a little girl. A group of people descends from the bus, and others wave to greet them. The boy follows this group into a building with staircases leading in various directions and numerous high-tech elements. Three individuals walk along a street, observing a multitude of highly advanced items.",

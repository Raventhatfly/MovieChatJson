The man barely grabs the small dog before he crashes to the ground. The airship continues moving forward and eventually crashes at the edge of a cliff. The area is filled with pink vegetation. Above the man and the dog, a row of flying creatures appears. The man picks up a blue creature from the ground, and he and the dog give chase. Suddenly, a purple sticky ball creature with tentacles emerges. A person with a flamethrower arrives and resolves the crisis. The man takes off his attire. Everyone gathers at the airship's front, where one man and a bearded man are engaged in a conversation.",

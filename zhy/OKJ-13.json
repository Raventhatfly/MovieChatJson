    "caption": "The girl took out a piece of fruit, and a massive beast suddenly burst out of a tent, coming onto the stage. A man in a suit also joined the stage. The audience below started throwing objects onto the stage, and something hit the man on the stage in the forehead. In a restaurant, several people were dining, unaware of the chaos happening on the stage. The girl continued to comfort the massive creature. Soon, a large number of police officers arrived, and the group with the giant animal tried to escape. However, they were quickly caught by officers wielding batons, who started to use force against them. On the street, a woman handed her phone to someone, lit a cigarette, and sat against a wall to smoke. Two people were walking on the street.",

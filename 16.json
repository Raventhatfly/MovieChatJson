 "caption": "A squirrel clung precariously to two cracking glacier edges, eventually tumbling down as the ice melted. The mammoth and its companions found themselves submerged in water but soon reached an open area teeming with animals. Swiftly, the prehistoric kangaroo and mammoth met their own kind. Later, one mammoth hung upside down from a tree and dropped down, while both mammoths and their friends traversed the glacier canyon, moving toward the setting sun. The film's opening squirrel seemed to have reached a paradise, a realm filled with its beloved acorns, scattered all around the heavenly landscape.",

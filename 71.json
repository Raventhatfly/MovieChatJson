 "caption": "A cat riding a dog bounces around on a bed. It walks in front of a servant carrying a plate, asking for a walk in the garden. A gentleman and a lady enter the house. The cat and dog make their way into the hallway. The cat dashes into the hallway, knocking over a flower pot. Shortly after, it breaks some porcelain. It then topples a sculpture, causing a domino effect of sculptures falling. The last sculpture ends up pinning a man to the ground. A man with his feet on a table is on a phone call. The little dog climbs onto the table. Later, they encounter many other animals in the barn. A man in black attire enters the estate with a dog, and they're met by the butler of the house.",

 "caption": "A bee is busy collecting nectar from flowers. Under the sunlight, there are flowers of various colors. The bee flies from one flower to another, and the flowers also attract various beetles. Beetles are seen fighting on the flower petals, and one tumbles to the ground. Two beetles interact on a flower. On the grassy plains, there's a group of antelope grazing. There are many butterflies around them, and the antelope move forward by leaping. At the seashore, waves crash against the coast. A group of dolphins is swimming ahead, and a blue whale appears on the sea's surface.",

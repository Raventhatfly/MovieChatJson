 "caption": "A large great white shark appeared in the ocean. In front of it, a whale emerged. The great white shark approached the dead whale and started to feed on its carcass. Waves crashed against the rocky coastline on the beach, where many penguins could be seen. They walked among the rocks, and one penguin left behind an egg on the stones. The penguins opened their beaks and called out to the sky. A lizard appeared on the rocks. In the sea waves, a penguin climbed out of the water onto the rocks. Two penguins approached each other and touched beaks in greeting.",

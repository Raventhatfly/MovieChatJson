 "caption": "One man sits beneath a weathered wall on a sofa, engaged in conversation with another man in a rather spacious room. Bookshelves and a lamp are visible in the room. The man in the chair gets up and proceeds to the fireplace to brew a pot of tea. Overhead, there is an airplane model, and he also retrieves a book before moving to the window. The man who was seated on the sofa stands up at this point, holding the book. The other man returns from the window and rushes to a phonograph. He places headphones on the man who was on the sofa and presents a microphone in front of him. The man then exits the room and encounters a woman outside.",

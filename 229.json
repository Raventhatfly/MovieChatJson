 "caption": "The video begins with the appearance of a man. Then, the sun and Earth are shown. The man gets into a car with an Einstein doll on the dashboard. As night falls, the stars in the sky move continuously. The man arrives at the side of an abandoned city wall, scattered with rubble. He enters the city and later reaches an open space where he sits down, reads a book, and points upward with his finger. On a rocky wall, he observes a pattern with stars, the moon, and a handprint. As the sun sets, a star undergoes a supernova explosion, creating a nebula. The man uses a screen to project the nebula. The video then shows a black hole emitting radiation from its poles. ",

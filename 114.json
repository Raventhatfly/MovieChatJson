 "caption": "It was raining heavily. A group of people held black umbrellas. Inside a tent, many people were typing on typewriters. A group of workers was digging in a cave. Many people were updating a scoreboard. The weather cleared up, and a man stood on a golf course with many spectators. Suddenly, the audience disappeared, and he found himself on a flat plain. He swung his club. Then he arrived at a water hazard, took a shot into the muddy water, and the ball popped out. After that, many people were playing golf in front of an audience. Inside a house, a group of people was drinking. A woman stood up from her chair and went to the yard.",

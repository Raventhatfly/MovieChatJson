 "caption": "Two people are riding a speedboat on the sea. Suddenly, a blue whale surfaces near them. They use crossbows and sticks to shoot something at the whale. After that, the scene shifts to Earth. Several blue whales are on the ocean's surface, breaching and then diving back into the water. The people on the speedboat continue to take photos. One of them takes a long pole and stands at the bow of the boat, attaching something orange to the back of the blue whale. The blue whale submerges and swims underwater. In the distance, a massive cargo ship appears on the sea. The actions of the people on the speedboat continue.",

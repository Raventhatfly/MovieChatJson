 "caption": "On the roadside, there was a green lizard and a peculiar creature. The lizard soon ventured into the depths of the desert. Along the way, he encountered four owls perched on the skull of a dead cow. The owls were playing various musical instruments. He moved closer to a cactus, only to be pricked by its thorns. Suddenly, an eagle swooped down from the sky, attempting to capture the green lizard. However, the eagle's head got accidentally stuck in a jar. Later, the lizard sought refuge inside a bottle to evade the eagle's pursuit. The eagle grabbed the bottle and threw it down. Night fell swiftly, and the lizard had a strange dream. The next day, the lizard was awakened by a gun-wielding lizard. A cart filled with bottles appeared.",

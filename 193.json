 "caption": "A group of children were performing as pirates on stage. They had created a simple pirate ship. A group of boys sat on outdoor benches. They arrived in front of a building, and a man walked out of the building. The man fainted in front of the building. In a classroom, a teacher sat at the podium. When class ended, the children left the classroom in a rush. One young boy was walking too slowly and was called back by the teacher. A man and a woman were having a conversation in a house. A group of children were lining up in the yard. At this moment, a woman in purple clothing walked by, and all the boys took out their books to read. The woman in purple clothing sat at the podium. She walked directly towards a bespectacled boy. A boy was making a phone call in a telephone booth, and the person who answered the call was from an auto repair shop.",

 "caption": "A group of race cars is chasing each other on the race track. There are intense collisions on the track, and many cars crash into each other, creating a cloud of smoke. Some cars lose their tires. From the midst of the smoke, a red car emerges and lands safely. The race continues, and in the audience stands, many cars with eyes are cheering loudly. The red car's rear wheels produce dazzling sparks. In the end, three cars simultaneously cross the finish line. The race cars are surrounded by their team, and many cars with cameras are taking pictures of them enthusiastically.",

 "caption": "A woman in a red dress is talking with a blond haired man inside a room. The woman can't help but cry, and at that moment, a woman in white enters the room. They embrace, and the woman in white comforts the one in the red dress. A group of prisoners stands in a line within the room, and the woman seems to be organizing papers and taking notes. She engages in a conversation with a man. As daylight breaks, people are placing a sign on the roof. Two women are counting money in one place, while another woman in blue is having a conversation with a man near a carriage. Shortly after, the woman drives away in her carriage and encounters a group of bandits who seem intent on stopping her.",

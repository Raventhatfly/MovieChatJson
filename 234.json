 "caption": "The video features a woman in a red dress, followed by the appearance of numerous stars moving in their fixed orbits. A white-haired elderly man is seen deducing the motion paths of planets on a blackboard. Next, there's a colossal telescope at an observatory filled with various equipment. A man is conducting maintenance, while a woman points at star images on a computer screen. They proceed with calculations on a blackboard. Many guests appear and start explaining various topics. The scene transitions to a nebula, within which a spherical object seems to emit some form of enchantment. Subsequently, the Milky Way is shown. The telescope starts operating and points towards the sky, while a group of scientists observes screens.",

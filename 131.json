 "caption": "An airplane is taking off. Several chipmunks, dressed in various outfits, come down an elevator. They approach an elderly woman and chat with her. Suddenly, the old lady, sitting in a wheelchair, descends the stairs. Several chipmunks sit in a man's car, and he engages in conversation with them from the driver's seat. The chipmunks are inside the house, drawing and taking out a snack. The man brings a video game console and presents it to the chipmunks. In a hospital, a man is hooked up to various medical devices. In the evening, the chipmunks start going to sleep, and one of them runs into the man's room. Soon, it's the next morning.",

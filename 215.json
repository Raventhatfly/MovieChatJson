 "caption": "In the midst of the desert, a pair of camels and a group of people are moving forward. Night falls, and the stars traverse the night sky. Daylight arrives, casting its warm glow upon wind-eroded rocks. A group of dung beetles, known as scarab beetles, appear. They're diligently pushing dung balls upside-down through the rocky terrain. A lizard perches on a tree branch above them. The dung beetle and its dung ball roll down to the sandy shore below repeatedly. Undeterred, the dung beetle continues its uphill journey, only to tumble down again. Eventually, the dung beetle takes flight. The scene transitions to a magnificent silvery landscape. Night descends, and near a water pond, many fish congregate.",

 "caption": "Two whales swim in the ocean, gracefully moving through the water. An expert is seated amidst numerous large brain specimens, engaged in discussion. The whales surface, revealing their majestic forms, and then dive back beneath the waves. The sea is teeming with a dense school of small fish, creating a mesmerizing underwater scene. The whales breach the surface again, their massive jaws wide open, attempting to engulf the small fish. Meanwhile, a small boat navigates the waters, with a man holding a camera capturing the spectacle. A woman onboard takes notes and communicates with her colleague via a walkie-talkie. The whales continue their journey through the vast ocean. Onshore, a man enters a building and sits at a desk, engaged in conversation. In an office setting, many people are engrossed in research. Someone stands on high ground, gazing out at the sea. Meanwhile, a man onboard a boat is changing clothes as they sail on the open water. ",

 "caption": "A group of people are holding guns, pointing them at a person lying in a pool of blood on the ground. Their expressions are very serious. The police have cordoned off the scene. In an office, many people are watching a television screen. On a car, two people are having a conversation. Suddenly, the car flips into a ditch. The driver remains in the driver's seat, his face covered in sweat, and blood is flowing from his stomach. Another man gets out of the car and gazes at the sunset. In the office, several police officers are having a meeting at a table. One of the police officers picks up the phone and calls a middle-aged man. There is a mobile phone in a plastic bag.",

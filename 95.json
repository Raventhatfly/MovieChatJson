 "caption": "A man and a woman are chatting. A little girl stands in front of a curtain, with two judges sitting below the stage. The little girl is wrapped in a yellow towel. A man is tidying up her hair. The girl goes to the kitchen and starts chopping carrots. Afterward, she picks up the phone. Another girl starts arguing with her, trying to grab the phone. At the other end of the phone, there's a boy responding. Meanwhile, something starts burning in the pot. They try to put it out with a broom, but the broom catches fire too. They quickly grab a fire extinguisher to put out the fire. The girl runs to the basement and then comes back up. Both girls stand in front of a rock. Finally, night falls.",

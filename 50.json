 "caption": "A man is working at his computer while a little girl in a yellow dress is playing in a room, sliding the door back and forth. The girl eventually leaves the room and starts bouncing around on the carpet, full of energy. She enters a bathroom where the walls are covered in bugs. She turns on the faucet to wash them away. Back in another room, the girl casually presses a button, which unexpectedly shuts down the man's computer, leaving him frustrated. The girl pushes aside an obstacle, revealing a small door in the wall. She and a woman open it, revealing a bricked-up wall behind. In the evening, the family gathers around the dining table for a meal. The girl lies down on her bed but quickly jumps up, heads downstairs, and opens the small door she found earlier. Inside, there's a tunnel that leads to another house where there's a woman and a man with button eyes.",

 "caption": "A man stands below an ice mountain, with a lake behind him. He walks on rocks, and pieces of ice float on the lake's surface. The man gazes into the distance, gesturing and explaining energetically to the camera. The glacier shows signs of fractures. The man traverses a snowy landscape and sits on a rock, continuing to gaze into the distance. He begins to provide explanations, and a glacier rises from the water, standing tall. It appears to be a result of glacier calving. The man arrives in a field, pulls out a picture of the night sky, and a blue star emerges.",

 "caption": "In the water, there were three sharks, a blue tropical fish, and a clownfish. The sharks were baring their teeth and eyeing the clownfish. Two small fish discovered a pair of diving goggles hanging on a piece of wood. The blue fish started bleeding, and the scent of blood attracted the large sharks. The sharks went into a frenzy, and the two small fish darted away desperately. They managed to squeeze into a narrow water pipe where the sharks couldn't reach them. A deep-sea mine was triggered, causing a massive explosion underwater. On the surface of the sea, two birds were swimming under the moonlight. Meanwhile, the clownfish was inside a fish tank with many other tropical fish. A seabird flew in through the window, and the clownfish began communicating with it. There was a man holding a photograph with a picture of a little girl holding a bag.",

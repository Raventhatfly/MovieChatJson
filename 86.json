 "caption": "A green lizard was in the study, facing a turtle in a wheelchair. They moved to the balcony, gazing out over the town. Below the town's clock tower, a group of animals was active. Various animals gathered in a bar. The green lizard pulled out a gun, pointing it at another animal. The animals went outside. The clock tower's hands pointed to 12 o'clock. All the animals stopped what they were doing and gathered in front of the square. Holding objects horizontally in their hands, they began to dance in formation. A turtle sat on a high platform and spoke to everyone using a microphone.",

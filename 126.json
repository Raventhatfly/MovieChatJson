 "caption": "A train is moving on the tracks, and the red car accelerates to cross the tracks before the train hits it. At night on a road, the red car encounters a large truck. The truck drops the red car, and a police car with flashing lights chases the red car. The red car drives into a small town, knocking down many roadblocks. Eventually, the red car gets entangled in ropes and can't move. It desperately tries to accelerate and escape but is ultimately hoisted up by the ropes. Then, there is a televised report showing the red car with wheel locks. The red car appears inside a room with many other vehicles.",

 "caption": "A couple and their two daughters are in the living room. The father chats and takes care of the baby at the same time. Then, the father starts making various strange gestures. He takes out a piece of paper and begins reading to everyone. The girl in blue drags a stool to reach the top fridge and opens it. The mother pushes the baby carriage to the dining table, and the family starts having breakfast while conversing. They eat and chat simultaneously. The girl in the blue dress goes to the bathroom and squirts all the toothpaste into the sink. Another girl, wearing green clothes, climbs a tree. Another woman finds her and joins her on the tree, and they chat while up there. The next day, one of the girls wakes up, goes downstairs, and sees excavators and some construction workers.",

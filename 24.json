 "caption": "A young boy crossed a stream and entered the wilderness. While swinging on a swing, he noticed a procession of vintage cars carrying soldiers. The vehicles stopped in front of a mansion, where the soldiers watched a film inside. The young boy sneaked a peek. Later, the boy ran to a wire fence where another boy in a prisoner's clothes was located. The scene then shifted to a funeral. A pastor walked before and after a carriage bearing a casket, followed by a group of people. Upon reaching the cemetery, everyone stood in silent mourning in front of the grave.",

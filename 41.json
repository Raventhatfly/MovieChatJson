 "caption": "An old man and a young boy walk through the night. Soon, they are caught in the beam of a giant spotlight. A massive net descends from the sky, trapping colorful birds. Due to the heat, the balloons attached to the old man's house burst one by one. The house begins to descend slowly. A pack of dogs drags away the bound birds, loading them onto an airship. The old man is distressed as he clings to the last bit of his house. They eventually reach a waterfall. The boy reluctantly drops his badge, but the old man picks it up. They return to their battered house, and the old man sits down, opening an album as memories flood back.",

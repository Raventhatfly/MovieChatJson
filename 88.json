 "caption": "On the hilltop during twilight, there was a fox. He circled around a tree several times. They walked shoulder to shoulder on the hillside. As they continued walking, they arrived at a farm. They stealthily entered the farm, navigating through various obstacles to avoid being noticed. Suddenly, a large cage descended from the sky. Inside the house, a fox was reading a newspaper. Breakfast was laid out in front of him. The fox's wife, dressed in yellow, was present. A mole came to the fox's house to inspect the drainage system. Three animals were chatting in the living room.",

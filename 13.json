 "caption": "At the beginning, a man used a pen to draw lines on a map. A family chatted in a room. Then, the scene showed a multitude of birds and gliders soaring in the sky, gracefully dancing together. The gliders performed intricate maneuvers high above. Afterward, a girl and her father ventured into a forest at night, seemingly searching for something with flashlights. The scene then shifted to a classroom. Finally, the screen depicted many caged birds, with two individuals engaged in a conversation, expressing concern and curiosity.",

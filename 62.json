 "caption": "A group of tropical fish, along with a stingray, gather together. The tropical fish ride on the back of the stingray and swim in the sea. A clownfish shouts excitedly to their companions. The stingray carries the tropical fish as it glides through the coral beneath the sea. It sets them down on a sandy seabed. Several small tropical fish swim into deeper waters. Something is floating on the surface of the sea. A clownfish leaves its companions and swims towards the floating object. Just as the clownfish is about to return, a scuba diver appears and captures the clownfish. The clownfish becomes distressed. It turns out the floating object is a speedboat, which quickly departs from the area. The clownfish is left feeling sad, but then it encounters a blue tropical fish and follows it.",

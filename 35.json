 "caption": "A group of people in suits and a middle-aged man in a gray jacket stand at the entrance of a building. In front of them are a group of children. Afterwards, two middle-aged individuals walk into a room, carrying boxes with them as they exit. Soon, the middle-aged man takes on the role of a teacher. In the hallway, a group of children behind closed doors is making a ruckus. When they see the teacher approaching, they quickly stop. The teacher stumbles, and his bag falls to the ground. The students grab the bag and toss it around in the air. The chaos only subsides when a man in a suit enters the scene. Later, the teacher holds the arm of a child in blue clothing and leads them out of the classroom.",

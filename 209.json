 "caption": "On the beach, a group of baby sea turtles struggled to make their way to the sea. Crabs on the beach tried to hinder their progress. Some birds swooped down and snatched a few baby turtles. However, many of the baby sea turtles successfully reached the ocean. One bird flew down from a tree branch and dived towards the water. The sky was filled with numerous clouds. The camera moved through the layers of clouds and arrived at a mountain range, where heavy rain began to pour. Below was a tropical rainforest with stunningly beautiful butterflies. At the peak of a mountain, many butterflies gathered, continually dancing in the air.",

 "caption": "A cat, a mouse, and a woman in a dress rushed into a building. One mouse came to open the door for the other. Then, the main door of the building opened, and the woman and the cat entered. Two dogs dressed as police officers stood outside the door. The cat, woman, and mouse hid inside a statue. Later, they made a hasty escape. Two dogs began playing musical instruments near the statue. The cat and the mouse got stuck inside the mechanical structure of the instrument. As the two dogs played their instruments, the cat and mouse were flung out. In a bar filled with animals, a lady was performing on stage. Two mice were running around with a diamond, and a winged creature had a rocket activated behind it.",

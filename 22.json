 "caption": "The girl sat on her bed, holding a flower. On that day at school, boys and girls exchanged flowers with each other. Four girls arrived at the school's swimming pool and playfully pushed one of their friends into the water. By the poolside, a handsome young man was taking photographs. The girl gave her flower to the boy, and they engaged in conversation. Later, the girl accidentally fell into the water, emerging from the pool drenched and disappointed. The boy also returned home to a family-run shop. After exchanging greetings with his family, he went to his study and picked up a photo album filled with many pictures accompanied by text.",

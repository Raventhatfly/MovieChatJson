 "caption": "The man is holding something in his hand and continues to explain, often pointing towards the distance. A small deer appears in the distance, and the man walks towards it. The scene shows something blue. The man reappears and walks towards the setting sun. A planet passes in front of a star. The man arrives at a rocky beach, where he stacks two stones on a larger rock and continually rearranges them. He proceeds to walk on the rocky shore. Later, he appears in a snowy landscape. The Milky Way passes overhead. In the daytime, the man resumes explaining. The video then displays planets and stars.",
